## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Craig (he/him). I am currently reviewing conditional logic and loops. It seemed to give me the most trouble in the prework. A fun fact about me is I am a passionate blood donor. I am always willing to collaborate and bounce ideas off the walls. The best way to reach me is my email, craig.evan.higgins@gmail.com.
